The solution involves correcting the `tailwind.config.js` file and ensuring correct integration with your build process. This often involves:

1. **Verify `content` array:** Ensure that the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` accurately points to all the files containing Tailwind CSS classes. The exact path will depend on your project.  An example: 
```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};
```

2. **Correct build process:**  The specific fix will vary depending on the build tool (Webpack, Vite, etc.).  In many cases, this involves ensuring that the Tailwind CSS plugin is correctly configured in your build configuration.  Consult your framework's documentation for details.  Make sure that the proper plugins are included, and if you are using purgeCSS, check that it's configured correctly.

3. **PostCSS Configuration:** If using PostCSS, ensure it is configured correctly. The configuration will depend on the build process and the tools in use. Often you need to add a PostCSS plugin for TailwindCSS to the PostCSS configuration.

After making these corrections, rebuild your project.  The missing or incorrect Tailwind classes should now be correctly generated.
